## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ sidebase is an open-source initiative by [@sidestream-tech](https://github.com/sidestream-tech). We open-source libraries, cli's and helpers that we use internally for our commercial projects. We hope to enable more people to do solve complex problems and build awesome projects :rocket: 

💳 [Sponsor us](https://github.com/sponsors/sidebase) if you want the open-sourcing to go faster & better :D
