## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ sidebase is an open-source initiative by [@sidestream-tech](https://github.com/sidestream-tech). We open-source libraries, cli's and helpers that we use internally for our commercial projects. We hope to enable more people to do solve complex problems and build awesome projects :rocket: 

🌈 Get involved by joining our [discord](https://discord.gg/9MUHR8WT9B), following our [twitter](https://twitter.com/sidebase_io) or opening issues and pull requests on our repositories here (: 

👩‍💻 You can find our website here: https://sidebase.io/ - at the moment most of the things are going on discord though
